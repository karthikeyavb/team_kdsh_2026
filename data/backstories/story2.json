    "backstory": "Edmond Dantès is a young sailor of nineteen or twenty, known for his skill and calm resolution in the face of danger. He serves as the first mate on the ship Pharaon, owned by Morrel & Son. He is a devoted son who cares deeply for his elderly, impoverished father, often prioritizing his father's needs above his own. Edmond is engaged to the beautiful Mercédès, whom he loves dearly. He is widely respected by the crew for his competence and leadership, although he has unknowingly incited jealousy in the ship's supercargo, Danglars. Following the death of Captain Leclere during a voyage, Edmond took command and handled the ship expertly, earning the trust of the shipowner, Monsieur Morrel. He is expected to be named the new captain of the Pharaon, a promotion that fulfills his professional ambitions and will allow him to support his family."
